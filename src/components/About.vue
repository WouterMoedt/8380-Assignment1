    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This application has been developed with Vue.Js and serves as practice for the ISQA 8380 course.</p>
    <p>Currently, it features the possibility to add and remove to-do's.</p>
    <p>Ideally, it would offer multiple lists of to-do's, in order to allow for categorizing.</p>
    <br> </br>
    <p>So far, I have played around with changing content and animations.</p>
    <p>My next goal is to create a second list or add categories</p>
